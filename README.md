Parking system for the course 2IMN15 

To run this program, run the following command in the `server` folder:

    mvn clean install

Then using the Eclipse IDE, open the server folder as project and run the main file called `LeshanServerIOT.java`.

The webserver will then be available at `localhost:8080`.

This implementation has been tested using the LwM2M clients found in the `clients` folder.
